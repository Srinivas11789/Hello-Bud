# Idea based on Virtual Assistant + Graduate Study Guide + Idea Formulation - Workflow

## Inspiration

A Assistant to help making critical and worthy decisions that lead to a greater impact in Education (Graduate Education) as well as Project Planning.
--- Assistant for Graduate Study or University Education (An Helping Hand for all education purposes) 
--- Assistant for Project Planning (From Idea to Reality)
--- Suggestions based on the best possible impact and dynamic programming
--- Re Inventing the Clippy Assistant (Of Microsoft)

## What it does
--- Assists a student throughout his University Education 
     - Study and Work Planner
     - Aids in learning
     - Make Important decisions on how to take up the work over each week
     - Prioritize the work based on the syllabus weight
     - Analysis of the load of course work and amount of hours to work each week
     - Reminds and Pushes to meet deadlines
     - Syncs with University (From the Servers) and Communication respective news and events to the Student
     - Syncs with Students and Organizers to communicate about events (Hackathons) happening around based on the     student interest

--- Assists a person throughout his Project Planning and Execution

## How we built it
--- Starting from the Scratch from the Voice Assistant Backwards using Python
     Voice Conversions ---> Data Fetch ---> Analysis ---> Output the efficient solution ---> GUI

## Challenges we ran into
--- Increasing the accuracy of Voice/Text conversion and vice-versa
--- Building the GUI, Clip Assistant (Similar to Microsoft) and Integrating to the project
--- Extend the scope of Algorithm techniques to achieve a best possible solution

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
--- Built a Self contained Voice/Text assistant who can communicate
--- Replicated the Microsoft Clip Assistant with two actions
--- Performed the Algorithm workflow for Education

## What we learned
--- Knowledge and Considerations for a Virtual Assistant
--- Efficiency of an Algorithm
--- More and More of Python

## What's next for Hello! Bud - A Graduate Assistant / Project Assistant
--- To enhance the Graduate Assistant Feature for various scenario handling
--- To elaborate the feature of Project Assistant - guiding through the Development Cycle over Various Stages to achieve Project Ideas to Reality making critical decisions
--- Integrate the GUI with the Algorithm and package as a standalone application
--- Export API to University and Even Organizers to feed information to Assistant so that It communicates to the student
